# Budget Tracker
Garrett Holmes - March 2024

This is a simple app I put together for tracking my spending over time and organizing it by category, date, etc.
Early days right now, I'm mostly playing around here with React Native & Expo, but I'm hoping to get this featured soon mainly because I hope to use it as a replacement for my current system of organizing my spending.
Feel free to download and mess around.

## Requirements
This app is built on React Native & Expo, which run on NodeJS. You also need and up to date Java installation (JDK).
Follow some guides if you need to get react-native running: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.
Once you've installed NodeJS you can use the node package manager (npm) to install the required packages.
I'll add to this list as packages are added.
- formik
- yup
- react-native-modal
- react-native-date-picker
- react-native-element-dropdown
- npx expo install @react-native-community/datetimepicker

## Running
- To run a dev build, use `npm start`
- I've been using my phone for development on the Expo Go app, which is pretty good. Just start up the app and scan the QR code in the console or type the address in directly.
